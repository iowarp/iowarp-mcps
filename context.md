1. go to parquet,Node_hardware or Slurm or HDF5 or plot or Adios folder and read folder structure and files.
2. now go to Pandas folder and explore folder. remove existing files and folder. just create new folder structure just like above mentioned mcp also implement server just like above mentioned mcp ex: plot or parquet.
3. just like node haardware,Slurm or HDF5 or plot  implement pandas mcp where:

    capability:
    # Data loading/export (CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet, HDF5)
    # Statistical summaries (mean, median, std, percentiles, distributions)
    # Missing data handling (detection, imputation, removal strategies)
    # Data cleaning (outlier detection, duplicate removal, type conversion)
    # Groupby operations (aggregations, transformations, filtering)
    # Merging/joining datasets (inner, outer, left, right joins)
    # Correlation analysis (Pearson, Spearman correlation matrices)
    # Time series operations (resampling, rolling windows, lag features)
    # Pivot tables and cross-tabulations
    # Data filtering and boolean indexing
    # Hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests)
    # Data validation (range checks, consistency validation)
    # Memory optimization (efficient dtypes, chunking for large data)
    # Quick data profiling (shape, info, describe, value counts) and also implement any features that i skip here if you think.

4. after that run server , run test using pytest and capabilities using uv also server can be run by using name called pandas-mcp. dont use other option then uv.
5. update readme.md just like parquet or plot or slurm or adios readme
